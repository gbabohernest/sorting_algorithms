# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

**This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in the C programming language,
along with an exploration of their time complexity using Big O notation.**


## Overview

**Sorting is fundamental operation in computer science and plays a crucial role in many applications. This repository is created as part
of the FullStack SE-Program at ALX to explore different sorting algorithms and their efficieny in terms of time complexity using Big O notation.**


### Sorting Algorithms

**We have implemented and analyzed the following sorting algorithms:**

 - Bubble Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Merge Sort
 - Quick Sort 
 - Shell sort
 - Cocktail sort
 - Counting sort
 - Heap sort
 - Radix sort

**Each algorithm is implemented in C.**

### Big O Analysis

**For each sorting algorithm, a brief analysis of its time complexity is given using Big O notation, including**

 - Best case
 - Average case
 - Worst case

**Undertanding the efficiency of these algorithms is essential when choosing the right sorting method for different scenarios.**
